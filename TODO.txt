MASTER TODO LIST:
  -Documentation //in progress
  -CHECK License compatability with portaudio //should be okay
  -FILL OUT README and other helpful files
  -Write more tests


  -work on s24 sample class, make sure it works
  -look into creating a buffer class that wraps the plain c-style array buffers used now.
    -or maybe something like a "frame_iterator"

  -check default_stream_error_callback and stream_api::_on_process to make sure error reporting works correctly




LONGTERM GOALS LIST:
  -begin work on libsndfile api backend
  -enable use of different api's for input and output
  -enable use of multiple api's at the same time
  -consider sample rate conversion functionality via libsamplerate for platforms where a certain sample rate isn't available
  -replace use of portaudio with platform specific apis, ALSA, COREAUDIO, ASIO, WASAPI, JACK, ... (use portaudio as a reference if needed)
